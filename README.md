# Play the Flappy Bird Game using PyGAD (Genetic Algorithm)

PyGAD is a Python library for general-purpose genetic algorithm applications. [Find PyGAD documentation at Read The Docs](https://pygad.readthedocs.io).

To run the project, first install PyGAD:

```
pip3 install pygad
```

Then, run the [main.py](main.py) script.

This is a video demonstrating how PyGAD plays the flappy bird game.

Note that the original game is taken from [this link](https://codewithharry.com/videos/python-tutorials-for-absolute-beginners-122). It was edited to make it sitable for use with PyGAD.
